hello, here is a text file.
This file will be read, and split into individual words. These words will then be grouped into triplets, with every word acting as the first item of a sequence.
Then, these sequences will be used to create a dictionary, or cache, with a word pair tuple as the key. Each of these tuple keys will have a list of words that were found to appear directly after the key tuple pair.
THis cache will then be dunped into a json file, so that the bot can quickly load this cache on later calls.
